# Bridging Fashion Gaps: Integrating Local Markets and AI-Driven Personalization

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for our submission to the Myntra "We for She" Hackathon. This project consists of two major integrated components aimed at bridging critical gaps in inclusivity and personalization in the fashion industry. 

### Project 1: Local Market Integration and Budget-Friendly Chatbot

1. **Local Market Integration:** We aim to integrate famous local markets and handicraft artisans into the Myntra platform. This will provide a diverse range of budget-friendly products, catering to the needs of all demographics, including boomers who prefer traditional wear and budget-conscious shoppers.

2. **Budget-Friendly Chatbot:** A chatbot designed to ask users for their budget and recommend styles, dresses, and accessories within that budget. The chatbot also offers festival-specific suggestions and styling tips.

### Project 2: MyntraStyle Guru

1. **Personalized Fashion Guidance:** An AI-driven consultant that offers users personalized fashion advice, monthly trend reports, and promotes body positivity. It leverages user data from various platforms to provide tailored recommendations and helps users feel comfortable and confident in their own styles.
